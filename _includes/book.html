                <p class="text-faded">I'm writing a book named "La via di Mezzo".<br />
It's still a work in progress, slowly taking shape.<br />
It's a collection of notes and ideas â€” ranging from happiness, to environmental issues, to justice, and more.<br />
If I happen to die before it's finished, I'd like it to be published as-is.<br />
You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/iacoposk8/ViaDiMezzo" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

                    If it's recent, I'm (probably) still alive ðŸ«€
                    
                    If it's been a while... who knows. Maybe it's time to publish it.-->
