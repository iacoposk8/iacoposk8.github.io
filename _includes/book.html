It's still a work in progress, slowly taking shape.<br />
It's a collection of notes and ideas â€” ranging from happiness, to environmental issues, to justice, and more.<br />
If I happen to die before it's finished, I'd like it to be published as-is.<br />
You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/iacoposk8/ViaDiMezzo" target="_blank">GitHub</a><br /><br /><br />
