## Smartphone - Apple Vs other brands
I've always wondered why apple can sell so many iPhones. I always felt that it offered nothing more than other smartphones in terms of performance and innovation. I wanted to confirm my impression by comparing objective parameters with the main brands (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus). To choose which smartphones to compare I based on the most popular ones by brand according to the site: <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/" target="_blank">gsmarena.com</a>.
To compare the GPUs I relied on the reports of: <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/" target="_blank">notebookcheck.net</a>.

## Metodo Croce
On the internet you can hear about the "metodo croce" (I don't know the English translation, maybe cross method) that promises to earn money with roulette.
Example:
If you bet on red and come out red, you make the next bet on black.
If you bet black and it comes out red the next time you bet twice on black, if you lose bet qudruple on black and so on.
So when you win you will be able to recover all the losses and have a profit.
The problem with this method is that you can lose up to 20 times in a row and even if you bet only one cent it will become more than 5000 euros or dollars.
This script proves that you always lose! sometimes it takes a few hours, sometimes a few weeks, but sooner or later you always lose.
Also check the money and time, you can have earnings (which sooner or later you lose) but in very long times.
