title: Worldwide Governance Indicators in Italy
---

Chart illustrating the Worldwide Governance Indicators in Italy, aimed at evaluating the performance of different political parties. The chart provides an overview of how governance indicators have varied across different administrations over time. It appears that there is no particularly striking evidence of differences in performance among the parties. However, a slight trend emerges showing that center-left governments tend to achieve somewhat better results.
It is important to note that these results should be contextualized carefully. Often, governments continue and build upon proposals initiated by their predecessors, which can influence the apparent performance outcomes.
