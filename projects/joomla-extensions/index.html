<h2>Article Pager</h2>
Article Pager for Joomla transforms content management by providing customizable article templates. Ideal for sections like ‘book reviews,’ it allows for consistent layout designs with specific fonts, colors, and arrangements. Create a template once using Joomla’s editor, then simply use tags for variable content like titles and descriptions. Associate each template with an article category, and upon selection, the text auto-fills with the chosen layout. Update the template to change the layout across all linked pages. For inquiries, contact the developer.
