## Article Tool
Article Tool is a Joomla plugin that enhances articles and K2 articles with additional features. Among the pluginâ€™s capabilities, you can choose to display buttons for printing, downloading (in the PRO version), sharing, and emailing the article. The supported social media icons include Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, and TikTok. These icons can be placed at the top or bottom of the article. The download function offers two options: creating a PDF displayed in the browser or generating a downloadable PDF. Both printing and PDF creation require no special configurations for individual items; simply activate the plugin. Additionally, you can customize the appearance of printed or downloaded content using style sheets (e.g., font, color, background, line spacing). Article Tool is also compatible with K2. For any issues or suggestions, feel free to contact the developer!
