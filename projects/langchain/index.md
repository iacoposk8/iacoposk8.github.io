# Langchain - Semantic Search

I developed a small piece of code that leverages the capabilities of LangChain to perform semantic searches within a file. Unlike traditional keyword-based searches, this solution can understand the meaning of words and phrases, enabling it to find relevant information even when the terms used in the query donâ€™t exactly match those in the file.

Using LangChain makes it easy to integrate advanced language models with the data within the file, leading to more precise and efficient searches. This approach is particularly useful for extracting specific information from complex texts or for analyzing large amounts of data in a more intelligent and intuitive manner.
