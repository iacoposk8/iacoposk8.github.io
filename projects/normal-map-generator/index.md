# Tileable Normal Map Generator

This project provides a tool for generating seamless normal maps from grayscale images. The code processes the image to create a normal map, which is initially converted to SVG format to improve quality and scalability. The final output is a high-quality PNG file, suitable for use in applications requiring detailed, high-resolution textures.

Ideal for applications that need intricate, scalable textures, this utility ensures that the resulting PNG files maintain their clarity and detail even when resized. The intermediate SVG conversion guarantees enhanced quality throughout the process.
