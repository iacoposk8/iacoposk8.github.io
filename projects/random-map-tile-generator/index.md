# Random Map Tile Generator

This Node.js application is designed to randomly generate maps for 2D tile-based games using an XY grid system. It creates dynamic and procedurally generated environments by assigning different tile types to coordinates on the grid. Developers can easily customize the map size, tile types, and generation rules, allowing for unique game worlds with each new map. Ideal for game developers seeking an efficient and scalable solution for creating varied game levels.
