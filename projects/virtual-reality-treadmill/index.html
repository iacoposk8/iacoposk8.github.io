# Virtual Reality Treadmill

This project features a cutting-edge Arduino-powered controller that mimics the left analog stick of a gamepad, allowing you to control in-game actions through your physical movements. Designed to be worn on your back, this controller seamlessly integrates with workout equipment such as treadmills, stationary bikes, and ellipticals.
