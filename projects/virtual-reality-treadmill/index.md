# Virtual Reality Treadmill

Work in progress.
Actually, the project is finished but Iâ€™m waiting for the summer when I have a bit more time to make the video. This device, developed with Arduino, will be attached behind the shirt collar and will function as a sort of joystick to control characters in a videogame. It will be possible to run in place, on a treadmill, perhaps even on a stationary bike and an elliptical.
