#HaptiPlay
Web Games: Play by Feel, Not by Sight or Sound.

I'm developing a suite of web games that rely entirely on tactile feedback (vibration) from mobile devices as the main method for interaction and conveying information. This design makes them uniquely accessible for blind and low-vision users and is perfect for silent play in any environment.

Enjoy games discreetly, anytime, anywhere, without bothering others!

## Combact
This is a combat game where you must master of attack and defense.

Feel the enemy's presence and dodge incoming threats using only timely tactile cues.

## Maze
This is a first-person maze. Navigate through hidden walls and unseen turns, where your sense of touch and direction is the only map you have.
