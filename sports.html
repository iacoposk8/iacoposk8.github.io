<h1>Best Sports Moments (Work in Progress)</h1>
<br />
<p>Welcome to my collection of the most memorable sports moments! In this section, I share the milestones I've achieved in various sports disciplines. While they may be small, these moments represent significant personal achievements and my ongoing pursuit of improvement and well-being. All with the goal of getting by in everything but never being truly good at anything! :)</p>

    <h2>Hiking</h5>
    <p>One of my most significant sports achievements was the walk to Capanna Margherita, the highest refuge in Europe at 4,554 meters above sea level. Without any specific preparation, we managed to ascend and descend in a single day. It was an unforgettable experience, proving that sometimes improvisation leads to great results!</p>

    <h2>Swimming</h5>
    <p>Another memorable sports moment was crossing Lake Maggiore. Once again, without any preparation – because who needs preparation, right? – I somehow made it to the other shore. I wouldn’t recommend it as a strategy, but I must admit that improvisation has become my specialty in sports challenges!</p>

    <h2>Running</h5>
    <p>One of my most curious running achievements was a run around Lake Varese. I initially planned to cover only 10 or 15 km, as usual. After running 8 km, it seemed like I was halfway around the lake, so I figured it wouldn’t make much difference whether I continued or turned back. Unfortunately, my eye deceived me, and I ended up running 29 km! And as if that wasn’t enough, I had to leave the track at some point... because I couldn’t find a single water fountain! But I have to say, it made me want to try a marathon... this time, I'll actually prepare!</p>

    <h2>Running 5K</h5>
    <p>After a whole summer without running, I thought: what better way to start again than with a nice race? So, I jumped into a 5 km run and, to my surprise, finished in just under 20 minutes. I'd also like to highlight my professionalism: phone in hand, wired earphones and 10-euro shoes from Decathlon!<br /><a href="https://www.move4all.eu/gara-5-km/" target="_blank">Click here for the ranking</a>.</p>

    <h2>Running 10K</h5>
    <p>For the 10 km run, I can finally say that I was training seriously. My goal was to finish it in 40 minutes, but just before the COVID quarantine, I tore my ACL while skateboarding. I had to stop for several months, and when I started again, I had lost a lot of speed, which demotivated me from training consistently. Despite everything, this was my best result.</p>
