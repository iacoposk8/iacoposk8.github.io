<h1>Best Sports Moments</h1>
<br />
Welcome to my collection of the most memorable sports moments! In this section, I share the milestones I've achieved in various sports disciplines. While they may be small, these moments represent significant personal achievements and my ongoing pursuit of improvement and well-being. All with the goal of getting by in everything but never being truly good at anything! :)

      Another memorable sports moment was crossing Lake Maggiore. Once again, without any preparation – because who needs preparation, right? – I somehow made it to the other shore. I wouldn’t recommend it as a strategy, but I must admit that improvisation has become my specialty in sports challenges!

<h2>Running</h2>

  <div class="col-md-8">
    <div class="p-3 border bg-light">
      One of my most curious running achievements was a run around Lake Varese. I initially planned to cover only 10 or 15 km, as usual. After running 8 km, it seemed like I was halfway around the lake, so I figured it wouldn’t make much difference whether I continued or turned back. Unfortunately, my eye deceived me, and I ended up running 30 km! And as if that wasn’t enough, I had to leave the track at some point... because I couldn’t find a single water fountain! But I have to say, it made me want to try a marathon... this time, I'll actually prepare!
